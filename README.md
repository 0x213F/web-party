**Status**: Finished.

This is a quick demo inspired by http://matmartinez.net/nsfw/.

Follow these steps to customize the program:

- Press the "Download ZIP" button.
- Add your favorite song to the folder and call it "dance.mp4" (I use Mambo5).
- Change the number in line 59 of javascript.js to change the dance speed.
- Double click "index.html" (or open it in your favorite web browser).

*Warning*: This contains flashing lights.

*Bonus*: If you have Phillips Hue lights, press your hub to extend the party to the whole room.
