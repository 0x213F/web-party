**Status**: almost done / debugging

This is a quick demo inspired by http://matmartinez.net/nsfw/.

Follow these steps to customize the program:

- Download all the files.
- Add your favorite song and call it "dance.mp4" (I use Mambo5).
- Change the number in line 59 of javascript.js to change the dance speed.

*Warning*: This contains flashing lights.

*Bonus*: If you have Phillips Hue lights, press your hub to extend the party to the whole room.
